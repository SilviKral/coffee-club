#Coffee Lovers

Coffee Lovers is a website presenting coffee club in Kaprun, Austria. The point is to inform potential (or current) members about joining regular meetings or occasional events, always connected with coffee. And of course, build a strong coffee community where everybody can learn something new. The last but not least great thing about the club is the locality. All happening is situated under the second highest Austrian mountain, where you can breathe fresh air and put the most clean water into your coffee!
